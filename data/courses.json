Prior to being an open-sourced framework, Bootstrap was known as Twitter Blueprint. A few months into development, Twitter held its first Hack Week and the project exploded as developers of all skill levels jumped in without any external guidance. It served as the style guide for internal tools development at the company for over a year before its public release, and continues to do so today.Originally released on August 19, 2011, we’ve since had over twenty releases, including two major rewrites with v2 and v3. With Bootstrap 2, we added responsive functionality to the entire framework as an optional styleSheet. Building on that with Bootstrap 3, we rewrote the library once more to make it responsive by default with a mobile first approach.",

JavaScript is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting language, widely used for controlling web page behavior.Contrary to popular misconception, JavaScript is not Interpreted Java. In a nutshell, JavaScript is a dynamic scripting language supporting prototype based object construction. The basic syntax is intentionally similar to both Java and C++ to reduce the number of new concepts required to learn the language.",
